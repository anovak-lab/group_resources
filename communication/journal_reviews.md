# Reviewing Journal Proofs

Reviewing journal proofs is the last step before an article is published - congratulations! Do *not* simply accept the first proof you receive - there very often are mistakes made by the editors. Read the entire paper; some specific things to keep an eye out for:

- Are the correct words capitalized in the title? Make sure that any software is capitalized, journals often de-capitalize it.
- Do the references look right? (Sometimes, the journals will put `Unknown et al.`  as an author or weird stuff like that)
- Do the equations look right? (Sometimes, journals randomly change the symbols used)
- Are figures the same high-quality ones you submitted? (Sometimes, journals take screenshots of original figures and they end up blurry)
- Are the figures laid out in a reasonable way? (Sometimes, journals put like 8 figures on one page, and then no figures for 4-5 pages, which can make the practical reading experience for the reader annoying, when it'd be better to interleave the figures more in the text). You can request changes to the layout.
- Are the figures the size you want them to be? Do you want any figures to be very large, spanning 2 columns instead of 1?
