# Checklist for New Graduate Students

* Create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com).

* Request an INL HPC account via the [NCRC portal](https://ncrcaims.inl.gov/Identity/Account/Login). Once logged in, complete the profile section, upload required documents and then go to the HPC account section and submit a request for HPC. Be sure to provide a detailed justification for why you need HPC access. If you need access to INL nuclear codes, you can go to the Licensed software section and submit a request for codes needed.
  - Ask Professor Novak for help with the justification part
  - Ask Professor Novak what nuclear codes you need access to

* Ask Professor Novak if you should also request access to other HPC systems.

* Download the UIUC [VPN client](https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/42/UIUC/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=167). You will need to be signed in to the VPN if you want to access Pinchot from off-campus. Otherwise, you can access Pinchot just by being on the UIUC wifi ("Illinois Net").

* Ask Professor Novak to add you to the Pinchot users list. Try logging in following the instructions [here](https://github.com/anovak-lab/group_resources/blob/master/computing/pinchot.md).

* Review the group policies [here](https://github.com/anovak-lab/group_resources/blob/master/policies/expectations.pdf).

* Complete an annual plan [here](https://github.com/anovak-lab/group_resources/blob/master/policies/annual_plan.tex) and email to Professor Novak.

* Ask Professor Novak to create a Google Doc for tracking research updates/meeting notes.

* Talk with Barb Russell and/or Sarah Drum in Suite 100 Talbot about getting a key to 225D Talbot (the student office)

* Go get an iCard, then email Barb about getting added to the list of people who can access Talbot after-hours.

* If you are an international student, open a bank account. You will need this for direct deposit.

* For weekly meetings with Professor Novak, please sign up on her [in-person calendar](https://ajnovak2.youcanbook.me/) (preferred if possible) or [virtual calendar](https://ajnovak2-6.youcanbook.me/). Please sign up for meetings on Mondays and select a time immediately adjacent to an unavailable time on the calendar (so that you can leave open as many 1-hour slots as possible in case a student needs that much time).
